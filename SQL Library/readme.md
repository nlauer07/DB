This SQL project demonstrates a simple relational database system designed to manage a library's collection of books, members, and borrowing activities. The database consists of three tables: Books, Members, and BorrowedBooks, with foreign key relationships between them. The project includes essential SQL operations like creating tables, inserting data, and performing complex queries with joins, subqueries, and aggregations.
